A rudimentary tool for pulling collection records from a CDWAlite source
(eg. http://collections.walkerart.org/oai/) and inserting them into a
CollectionSpace instance (http://collectionspace.org/) via its REST API
(see
http://wiki.collectionspace.org/display/collectionspace/Common+Services+REST+API+documentation
for details).

Running the code involves three steps:
1. Configuring the values in cspace_constants.py
2. Running save_list_of_cs_objects.py to generate a local listing of
   what objects are already in your CollectionSpace installation, which
   should prevent the insertion of duplicates
3. Running create_cspace_records.py to pull records from your OAI source
   and insert their data into your CollectionSpace instance.
